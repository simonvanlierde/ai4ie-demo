# ML reproducibility for IE research

Grounded in the recommendations of
[Rankin et al. (2026)](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-9270723/v1), a CML survey
of ML use in industrial ecology. The two failure modes that dominated that survey
are **data leakage** and **poor computational reporting**; every rule below traces
to one of them.

## When to apply

- The user is training, tuning, or evaluating any predictive model on research data.
- The user is writing the methods section for a study that used ML.
- The user is reviewing someone else's ML-using manuscript (see reviewer mode).

## Workflow rules (builder mode)

1. **Isolate the test set first.** Split the data before *any* preprocessing:
   normalization, gap-filling, feature selection, and outlier removal must be fit on
   the training set only. If the data has a time dimension, split by time
   (time-series cross-validation), never randomly.
2. **Ask whether ML is needed at all.** If the hypothesis can be tested with
   empirical data or a mechanistic model, prefer that. ML reproducibility errors
   can't occur in an analysis that doesn't use ML.
3. **Fit the simplest model first.** Report a linear-regression (or equivalent)
   baseline before any complex model. If the complex model barely beats it, say so —
   several best-practice studies found linear models nearly as good.
4. **Fill in a model info sheet.** Use Kapoor & Narayanan's model info sheets to
   self-evaluate the study against known leakage types before writing up.
5. **Describe the pipeline plainly, in order.** The write-up must say things like
   "we split the data, then normalized, then trained" — a reader should be able to
   confirm the order of operations from the text alone.
6. **Justify anything withheld.** If data, code, or model weights can't be shared
   (e.g. proprietary data), state why, and point to where similar data could be
   obtained. Transparency is the default; withholding is the documented exception.
7. **Hunt for assumptions.** Before trusting a good test metric, ask: does the data
   reflect the process being modeled? Are there hidden assumptions (sampling,
   temporal ordering, unit handling) that condition the result? Treat this like the
   sensitivity analysis of an LCA/MFA.

## Reviewer mode

When reviewing an ML-using study, check the three **disqualifying errors** first —
they need no ML expertise to spot, and any one of them puts the results in serious
dispute:

- [ ] No hold-out test set at all.
- [ ] Temporal leakage: random splits on time-structured data.
- [ ] Normalization, gap-filling, or feature selection performed *before* the
      train/test split.

Then the softer checks:

- [ ] Is a simple baseline reported alongside the complex model?
- [ ] Is the pipeline order stated plainly in the methods?
- [ ] If data/models are withheld, is the reason stated and reasonable? (Withheld
      data alone is *not* disqualifying when the rest follows best practice.)
- [ ] If you can't tell whether an error is present, that ambiguity is itself a
      finding — request clarification in revision rather than guessing.

## Output

When applying this skill, state explicitly which rules were checked and what was
found — "checked test-set isolation: split happens in `split.py` before the scaler
is fit — OK" — not a generic "looks reproducible".
