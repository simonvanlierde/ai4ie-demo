// Shared tag vocabulary: used by the literature list, the applications map,
// and the schema validation in content.config.ts. Add new tags here first;
// the collections test enforces that data files only use tags defined here.
// Areas with no vetted entries yet are deliberately absent: add the tag together
// with its first entry. The known gaps are named under "Not mapped yet" on the
// applications map, so the absences stay visible instead of implicit.
